# Exo

Exo is a gamebook videogame made in C language with the ncurses library

our limitations were to only use ncurses library (stdlib and stdio were allowed)
and limit ourselfs to only the windows console terminal

the goal was to recreate all the tools nesessary to create the game such as :
* File System
* File Parsing
* User interface/navigation
* Custom image format
* Custom image displayer

to cope with our limitations i made a custom python program to transform PNG images into a custom image format that was able to be displayed on the terminal using a limited set of colors
