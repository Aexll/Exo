!30190!Their burrow is strangely large for such small creatures, once inside, all the tiny balls
hide themselves from you while observing you. Your attention then turns to all

but the environment remains very dark,
it is difficult to see properly despite this you keep walking.

#1# Use a distress signal light from your toolkit.
#2# Brandish the skin and teeth to intimidate the creatures.
