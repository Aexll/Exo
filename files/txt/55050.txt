!55050!Finally. After all of this time, after all of the troubles, your goal is within your grasp\!
The signal is so strong now, you even feel a little lightheaded. The two massive doors standing
in front of you are unlike anything you've ever seen. Beautifully decorated, they remind you of
antiquities that you only saw in history books.

However, you are now faced with a big problem: These doors must certainly be heavy, and they look
like they have not been opened in ages. If you were to force them open, it will likely make
a lot of noise. The doors might get damaged in the process too, which could anger the locals.
You'd rather not add "destroyer of priceless artifact" to your resume right now. 
On the other hand, this could very  well be your only choice if you want to leave this planet.
