!52030!The creature on the wall menacingly crawls toward the army.
It stands tall, almost three time bigger than any  of the humanoid
figures and his head is crowned with three sets of two horns. The
exact number of limbs is a little unclear, but judging by the amount
of dead warriors on the ground, it seems to have no trouble being
able to fight a lot of people at once, which worries you considerably.
Praying that such a creature only exists in folktales, you make
your way further inside the temple.
