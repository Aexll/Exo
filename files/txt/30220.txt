!30220!After lighting the red flare, you can see that there are sort of indentation to walk through the cave. 
Your radar has now weirdly changed and seems to indicate this direction, so you go deeper following
the new signal. After some time there is a bifurcation; the first path has weird markings
but the second has the stronger signal.

#0# The radar knows the good way.
#1# You follow the marks and trust the monsters.
