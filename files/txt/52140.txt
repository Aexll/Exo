!52140!Battered and bruised, you do not even take the time to check if your rifle is still
working properly before aiming it at the creature. This monster is relentless,
and your body likely won't be able to keep dodging for very long.

opening its massive jaw in a terrifying attack.

stomach, leading you to believe that you might have been eaten.
