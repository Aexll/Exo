!50010!As you make your way throught the jungle, the path under your feet start climbing up and up.
With ragged breath, you mark a pause in your travel to gather your forces.
As you sit on a tree root, you notice that the path that you were on seems to have been travelled

in the direction of the signal, now stronger than ever.
