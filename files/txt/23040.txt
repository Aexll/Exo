!23040!You take advantage of a moment when no one is watching to sneak out near the fragile bark.
In a matter of seconds, you manage to break a path through the thin wood.

By the time the guards react you've already passed one of your legs through the opening.
But as they start coming for you make your whole body cross through.

Now in the dark, you hold your breath, hoping that the tip of their spear won't you reach you.
On the other side you hear the Rahk'at panicking, and judging by the sound of their footsteps
they're trying to break through, but soon all the noises ceases and the footsteps fade away.

#0# Get out and get the pot
#1# Wait for a moment
