!30250!You take and open the logbook of the ship, before starting to read what's in it.
$TDay 1: After the mother ship was damaged, the three of us were forced
to leave it and take this safety capsule.
After we escaped, we crashed on this weird planet that we have little data on and on top of it the pod's radio
stopped working for some reason\! After we found out that this place
is a gigantic desert, we decided to leave this place and abandon
our capsule here. We'll place a few sandtraps around it and leave a few markings on trees to return here./$T
