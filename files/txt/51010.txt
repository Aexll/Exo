!51010!As you enter the strange room, you feel a strange sensation crawl upon your skin.
Looking around, you find a stone cube placed on an altar at the center of the room.
Multiple stone doors face you on the other side of the room, but most of them are closed.
As you take a closer look at the cube, you realise that its sides have been carefully
scultped to ressemble a puzzle box or some kind of mechanism. If you were to fix the cube
and place it again on the altar, could you open the stone doors\?

must pick the EVIL EYE \>\[1\]\< option\]/$r

#0# Spend time trying to solve the puzzle cube
