!41380!Three Razors are standing at the village's entrance. One of them is holding some kind of crocodile-like creature...
They might have been hunting while you and you friends were assaulting the village.
One of them clearly stand out. It's way taller than the usual aliens. Its body is covered in scars and white paints.
Instead of the usual vine-made belts, it is wearing some kind of pauldron, made of...metal ?
Salvaged for sure, considering its shape.
After a few seconds, the Razor lifts its weapon, a metal axe-like blade, and shriek a war cry.
The other Razors draw their weapons, and start approaching you.
