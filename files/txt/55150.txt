!55150!As you run back to the entrance of the temple, weird noises around you end up making you curious.
You sneek in a glance and confirm your suspicions; a group of natives are currently holding a ceremony inside the temple.

Taking every precaution possible, you sneak past them by taking advantage of rooms that you previously explored.
As it turns out, it ends up being fairly easy, as the natives seem to be very preoccupied with their ceremony,
allowing you to slip by unnoticed.

Urn in hand, you spend almost an entire day climbing back down toward your crash site.
Exhausted and almost fainting, you pour the contents of the urn into the emergency call station.
Even when the journey exhausted you this much, you can't help but smile while you wait for a rescue party...
