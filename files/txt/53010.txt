!53010!As you search around the entrance for hidden mechanisms, you discover something.
One of the carvings that looks like a small river has tiny bubbles sculpted 
into the wall. One of the biggest bubbles can be pushed inside the wall,
but your fingers are sadly too big to trigger the mechanism.

Thankfully, you do have a toolkit, and with it an ice pick\! You carefully use it
to press the stone button and hear a low rumbling sound. As you look around,
you realise that the wall on your left has opened. You enter the damp passageway
and notice that it is covered in rubble compared with the corridor that you
just left. As you wonder if it's worth it to go in this direction,
you notice that the secret passage is slowly closing\!

#0# Head into the secret passage without looking back
#1# Run back before the door closes & try one of the rooms
