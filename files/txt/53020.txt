!53020!As your progress through the tunnel, you end up arriving in an open area.
In front of you is a strange road that seems to have been built out of
dozens of pillar tops, each standing taller than 10 meters.
Since the way behind you is closed, you must find a way to progress
forward. But how ? Even if all of the pillars are less than a meter apart,
any error on your part will almost certainly lead to your death.

#0# Walk slowly and carefully across the pillar road
#1# Run on top of the pillar road
#2# Use the Grappling Hook to traverse the pillar road
