!30380!Since your eyes are not enough, you end up using your suit's emergency battery to light up your path.

Looking around, you notice that a few weird symbols have been carved in the rock next to you.
Following the trail of these strange symbols, you theorize that this strange tunnel was a tunnel
used by the inhabitants of this planet to move around. After half an hour of walking,
you arrive at another entrance.

It seems that the cave system has led you directly into a jungle.
You start walking again with enthusiasm. After all, this couldn't be worse than the cave\!

#0# Enter the jungle.
