Looking around the sculpted lines, you find out that you can easily rotate multiple pieces
of the device to change how the lines connect to each other.

You lose track of time as you focus on solving the cube, not letting small errors stall your progress.
As you face another roadblock, you realise that the finished cube has to fit on the slot
in the altar\! You quickly change the position of the angles and solve the cube\!
