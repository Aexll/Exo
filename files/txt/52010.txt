!52010!As you enter one of the rooms, you notice that everywhere here
is absolutely covered in glyphs and symbols.

Out of the large number of random inscriptions, you quickly notice 
a handful of carvings that draw your attention.
One of the biggest ones in the room looks like a gigantic flame, 
surrounded by shadowy figures. On the opposite wall, a conflict 
between two figures seems to tell an old legend. Finally,
on the right side, a strange monster covered in horns rises
while a group of humanoids armed with lances and claws
are attacking it. Several lie on the ground, possibly dead.
