!52090!Backing away slightly from the bones, you turn around as you hear a small grumbling noise
on your left.  As you do, you feel your heart sink into your chest.

A massive creature stands at the entrance of the room, scraping the top of the room with three
sets of two horns. It is very tall, easily above five meters, and its body is covered from
top to bottom in thick, black scales. The scales slightly reflect your suit's frontal lights,
creating thousands of small reflections that dance in the shadows.

Your panic only increases as you notice that the creature is slowly heading towards you while
it makes a low grumbling sound. No matter what you decide to do, you will likely only get one attempt.
Failing here means certain death.
