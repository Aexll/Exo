!30240!There is a weak natural bioluminescence in the cave that barely allows you to perceive the outline of your path.
You hear the growls of the creatures and you feel the danger coming. You arrive at
what seems to be two different paths but something prevents you from passing
by blocking your steps, so you take the other one and arrive in a slightly better lit
room where a huge being is sleeping.
After your arrival, the grunts concentrate and wake up the chief who after a shout launches all the monsters
after you. You see that you couldn't kill all of them, they're too much.
