!41360!Rook however, is not dead yet, as he grabs a combat knife from his gear.
He then repeatedly stabs it, then makes a deep slash in the beast's belly.
After long and painful seconds, the Razor finally passes out. You tooses the body out and checks on Rook.
The wounds in his belly are soo deep you can partially see his ripped out organs.
Rook coughs blood.
"Civ'...go...I won't make it. Tell Agria...I did my best."
You hesitate for a moment. He indeed won't make it, but leaving him helpless here...
