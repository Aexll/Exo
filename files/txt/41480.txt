!41480!Taking advantage of the Razor's disability, you quickly step on you right and land a second stab on its arm.
With a rageous grunt, it tries to hit you, but is immediatly stuck by the pain coming from you first blow.
As you reaches its back, you land a third hit between the beast's arm and neck, making it drop its axe.
Drunk with confidence, you try to hit it a thrid time...only to be struck by a deadly blow.
The Razor hit you with its right arm, with enough strength to violently nail you to the ground.
As he bend over you, you take full notice of its expression, on of a beast, giving it all to survive.
