!50060!You come into view of a massive stone temple, which had stayed hidden in the vegetation 
until now. You quickly check with your radar and your doubts are confirmed: 
the signal indeed comes from somehwere in the temple's depths.

You are slightly taken aback at the sight of the stairs leading to the
entrance of the temple: they are all too big and misshapen,
making you question what kind of creatures may have used them.

It takes you some time to climb the giant steps but you eventually 
come to face the stone arch that covers the entrance of the ruins.
