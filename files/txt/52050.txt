!52050!As you continue heading deeper inside the temple, you end up
facing a weird choice as you round out a stone corridor.
Right now, you face two corridors in the darkness, both heading
in completely different directions.

From your small source of light, you can only gather a little bit of
information before you make your choice: the corridor on the left
seems to continue into a flight of stairs heading up, while the
corridor on the right seems to have been abandoned for a while.

#0# Enter the corridor that ends in a flight of stairs
#1# Enter the corridor that is slightly damaged
