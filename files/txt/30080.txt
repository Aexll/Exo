!30080!You start out on a trail, with no idea of the temperature, the intensity of the heat crushes you with
all its might. After a few minutes, your steps start to feel heavier and after a few seconds, the sands
engulfs your legs. Without stress or hesitation you stop moving and let it go, as the suction suddenly stops.
You notice a shiny metallic reflection in the sand, which you identify as a trap.
It seems to have stopped working, but this is definitely the thing that set off that quicksand. As you look
up, you notice that you're not far from the pod that seems to have crashed recently.

#0# Enter the spaceship.
#1# Leave the pod here and resume your trip to the signal.
