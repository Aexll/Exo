!22000!Everyone converge on you out of curiosity, to such an extent that a large crowd start forming
around you and the village chief.

Now that you can take a closer look at them you realize these scaly creatures don't have eyelids
nor lips. Their teeths are upturned and you notice thin fur on their forearms.
Their hands ends up in two separeted fingers on which sit long claws that looks like razors.
Finally, you can see that the males are the only ones wearing blue trails on their scales.
 
On your own forearm, the signal on your radar is getting stronger as the crowd gets larger.
