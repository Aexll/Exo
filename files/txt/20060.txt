!20060!By the looks of it, it's been dead for several weeks. Its skin is streaked with blue lines
that are made up of a sort of powder. Not only that but it is scratched on several places.
It is craddling a spear in his arms. While you study the body your radar suddenly reacts.

While the signal is very weak, it is definitively there. It seem to be reacting to the /bblue powder/$g.

#0# Leave the body and keep going
