!55170!You close in on the signal, almost getting back to the entrance of the temple. Just as your radar
tells you that the energy source is located in the next room, you stop dead in your tracks.
You sneek in a glance and confirm your suspicions; a group of natives are currently holding a ceremony
inside the temple.

From your position, you can see several "dancers" moving in stranger patterns, as well as a figure of authority,
heavily clad in wooden trinkets. Your heart skips a beat when the radar locates the energy source; it's right there!
In the corner of the room lies a stone altar, upon which is placed an unassuming stone Urn. Without your radar,
you would have never guessed that it held the power to get you back home!
Now you only need to find a way to get it without alerting the natives...
