!55060!Dozens of alien lifeforms surround you, which would make escape impossible, 
even if you could move. However, they don't seem hostile. The ones that are carrying
you seem to have taken great care not to hurt you, and the others are simply walking,
carrying torches and spears.

They end up laying you on the ground, in the middle of some sort of hut. You barely
feel the ground under you. After a short while, a native looms over your face,
laying his hand on your forehead. You hear him make sounds, but you cannot understand him.
Instead, you simply look at him in the eyes, maintaining eye contact as he stops talking.
You see no hostility in him, only admiration, as you fall deeper into slumber.
