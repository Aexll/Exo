!41031!An explosion. You can hear some kind of bestial scream coming from the huts. One of them is already catching fire. 
This is the right moment.
You jump out of your cover and begin your charge. After a few seconds feeling like hours, you reach the wall.
Your moment of relief is quickly faded however, as you hear a sonorous grunt from above. 
One of the Razors is standing atop of the barricade, looking at you with visible rage..
