!53050!Trying your best to keep the pace, you continue going forward into a tunnel section
until the view clears again. You are slightly surprised as natural light floods your
vision, raising the hope that you are at the end of your troubles.

Sadly, the sound of a raging torrent breaks your daydreaming session. You now face
a massive stone bridge broken halfway in the middle which hangs over a furious river.

As you look around, you notice that you have come out of a building sculpted directly
in the rock. Perhaps there is a way up hidden somewhere in the ruins around you ?
Either way, it seems like you will need physical strength to move forward.

#0# Head toward the bridge
#1# Look around and try to find a way to climb back up
