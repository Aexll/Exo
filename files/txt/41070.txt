!41070!Three Razors are standing at the entrance. Judging by their attitude they weren't present during the assault.
One of them clearly stand out. It's taller than the usual aliens. Its body is covered in scars and white warpaints.
Instead of the usual vine-made belts, it is wearing some kind of pauldron, made of...metal?
Salvaged for sure, considering its shape.
After a few seconds, the Razor lifts its weapon, a metal axe-like blade, and shriek a war cry.
The other Razors draw their weapons, and start approaching you.
