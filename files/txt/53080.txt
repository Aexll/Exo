!53080!As you struggle to make your way to the other side, you suddenly feel the stones
under your foot give way, falling far below. You quickly grab on the side of the bridge,
but feel as sharp pain in your shoulder as your right arm has to suddenly support
all of your body.

With a lot of effort and time, you eventually manage to climb back up to the other side,
at no small price to your body. You lay there panting for a while, before a noise jolts
you to attention. Alerted by the weird sounds, you look to the other side of the bridge
and are appalled by what you find. Dozens of shadowy figures are slowly progressing 
across the bridge towards you. Panicked, you forget your fatigue and run like hell.
