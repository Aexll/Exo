!30200!Outside of the ship, you notice that a full Toolkit is just laying on the ground.
You grab it if you don't already have one. As you enter the crashed spaceship,
you discover that there is no one in it, and it seems to have been left alone recently.
There is not much dust inside and most of the equipment is still here. You look for information
and useful things in the cupboards and find a book with information on this planet.
This is the ship's logbook\!

#0# Read the logbook.
