!51020!As you move around the room, you end up stepping on a strange stone tile
which triggers a hidden mechanism. Before you can even remove your foot
from the pressure plate, you feel a sharp sting in your right leg.

and you drop to the floor. It takes you a while to adjust, but the pain
ends up fading away after some time. As you read the alert messages, you learn

Great.

With a grunt, you rise up to your feet and look around the room once more,
trying to ignore the stinging sensation in your leg.
