        Trying your best to follow the signal through the labyrinth of walls and stairs, you walk for what feels like hours.        
                                               Finally, after backtracing your steps,                                               
                           the signal leads you to a strange room where your radar simply stops working.                            
                                                                                                                                    
                                              Incredulous, you try to start it again.                                               
As you focus on your HUD, you fail to notice the faint glow appearing on the walls, as the corner of your vision twists into knots. 
                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
                                                        Huh? That's weird.                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
                        When did you start tracing the curves of the symbols on the walls with your fingers?                        
                                                                                                                                    
                                   Weren't you just looking at the pretty colors that they made?                                    
                                                                                                                                    
                                        It's a bit hard to see them with all of this smoke,                                         
                                 but you try to remember all of the ones you have seen so far just.                                 
                                                                one.                                                                
                                                               last.                                                                
                                                              time...                                                               
                                                                ...                                                                 
                                                                 .                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
                                You have forgotten your goal and will never leave the temple alive.                                 
                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
                                                  This is the end of your journey.
