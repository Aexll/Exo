                         It's been a year now that you are surviving alone in the middle of the wilderness.                         
                                                                                                                                    
                  You made sure the rahk'at got back the ashes by placing the pot near the entrance of the temple.                  
                               Yet you don't dare approach enter their settlement, fearing reprisals.                               
                                                                                                                                    
One day as you're walking dangerously close to their village you stumble upon three slashed human corpses along with their weapons, 
                            it seems you weren't the only one looking for an energy source, what a pity.                            
                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                    
                You bury them, but keep their armament, it might be useful to repel the beasts this planet can host.
