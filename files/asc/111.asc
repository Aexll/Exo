                                               A few years later...                                                
                                                                                                                   
                                  A strange ship lands on the surface of Uruk-7.                                   
                          To anyone observing, this would have looked like an antiquity,                           
                             almost crashing while it deccelerated toward the planet.                              
                Truly, the rickety ship had nothing to do on such a dangerous and deserted planet.                 
                                                                                                                   
                                                     However,                                                      
                                          to a select few in the galaxy,                                           
this ship would have been instantly recognised as the home to one of the most fanatatical explorers of their time. 
  As the various gadgets on the hull forced the ship to adapt a perfect descent trajectory at the latest moment,   
                                          you breathed a sigh of relief.                                           
                                                                                                                   
                  After spending many years destroying as much evidence as possible about Uruk-7,                  
                                             it felt good to be back.                                              
                                                                                                                   
               Grabbing your wide hat and the items that had saved your life here a dozen years ago,               
                                                                                                                   
                                           you headed out into the sun,                                            
                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
                                                  one more time.
