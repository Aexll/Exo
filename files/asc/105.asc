       A few years later you receive a call. As the only person to have ever set foot on the planet,       
                         your expertise is requested for an upcoming expedition.

 Once you arrive with a team of anthropologists, all your memories comes back to you, like little flashes. 
                                                                                                           
       Following your instinct you guide the team through the jungle until you reaches the village.        
      To your surprise it is lifeless, the only thing left are corpses laying down againts the huts.       
Outside the enclosure, the team discover that there were others survivors by spotting three human corpses. 
                                                                                                           
 Although some members of the crew hypothesize about mutual killing not all the aliens bear gunshot wound, 
                                     it seems they just extinguished.                                      
                                                                                                           
                                                                                                           
  With nothing left to see, the expedition ends prematurely, you repatriate the human bodies and go home.
