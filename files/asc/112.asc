                 The blue sun is setting for the last time.                  
                                                                             
  With the radio device, Agria managed to contact the remain of her fleet.   
                 A rescue ship should arrive at any minute.                  
                                                                             
          Around you everything seems to have regained its colors.           
     Rook and Cut are playing some kind of chess game with a few rocks.      
    Meanwhile Agria watches over them with a scornful yet relieved look.     
                                                                             
                                You did it.                                  
                              You all made it.   

                                                                             
                                                                             
           However you don't feel like taking part in festivities.     

For everywhere you look, you only see faces, faces of people you never knew. 
                Spectres watching you from the Great Beyond.  
                               
                   Wherever you look, you only see blood.    

                                 And fire.                                   
                                                                             
                                                                             
                        But hey, you survived, right?
