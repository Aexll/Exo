                  The red sun is setting for the last time.                  
                                                                             
  With the radio device, Agria managed to contact the remains of her fleet.  
                 A rescue ship should arrive at any minute.                  
                                                                             
   You made it, but you can't help but not feel as good as you should be.    
For everywhere you look, you only see faces, faces of people you never knew. 
                                                                             
                 Spectres judging you from the Great Beyond.                 
                                                                             
                                                                             
                       You dare not looking at Agria,                        
             but deep down you now she is seeing the same thing.             
                                                                             
                     Except she knew some of the faces.                      
                                                                             
                                                                             
                                                                             
                   Wherever you look, you only see blood.                    
                                                                             
                                  And fire.
