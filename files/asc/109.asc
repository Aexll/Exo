They knew. The tribe had faced multiple attacks by the strange soldiers, and many warriors of renown had perished. 
                                    However, tonight was not a night of defeat.                                    
   Carefully removing the lid of the clay pot, the Rakhat's hands trembled, unable to contain his apprehension.    
                                                                                                                   
                     Would his mind be able to withstand the power contained within the ashes?                     
                                                                                                                   
                       Could he inherit the ferocity of a warrior that killed a Karack'tack?                       
                                                                                                                   
                      However, it was not fury that the rakhat warrior inherited that night.                       
                                        Rather, his heart rate slowed down                                         
                                                                                                                   
                  while countless visions and tactics were brought to the forefront of his mind.                   
                                          When he exited the remote hut,                                           
                                              clad in black scales,                                                
                                                    they knew.                                                     
                                                                                                                   
                                   The Rakhats did not gain a warrior that day.                                    
                    Rather, they received a general that would guide their people to victory.                      
                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
                                        And no one would stand in his way.
