You draw your weapon and point the village chief at point blank range. Before it has the time to react you press the trigger. 
                    The decorated creature falls down behind your blast. A moment of astonishment follows,                    
                                 you can feel fear all around you before it turns into anger.                                 
                                                The entire crowd overwhelm you.                                             
                                                                                                                              
     You only manage to take down a few of them before their claws cut open your arms, your legs and finally your skull.      
                         Your body hits violently the ground, then everything becomes dark and cold.                          
                                                                                                                              
                                                        You are dead.
