              Those are your memories from one year ago. Since then you properly buried the three soldiers,              
        borrowing their guns and trying your best to survive on this planet with a little help from the Rahk'at.         
                                                                                                                         
But coexisting with them was not easy. This language barrier along with all their roots were a serious obstacle for you. 
                                            You had no choice but to adapt,                                              
                             hunting and eating things your stomach had to brace itself for.                             
                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                         
            You resolved yourself to these new ways of living, but the one that was the hardest to accept was            
                                      the idea that you would never see home again.
