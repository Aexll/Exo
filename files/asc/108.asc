You stand your ground in the middle of the room, trying to look for a weapon while you maintain vision with the massive creature. 
                                          You grab a sharp elongated bone off the floor,                                          
                                       just in time as the beast lunges in your direction.                                        
                                                                                                                                  
                        Dodging the initial charge is easy,as you simply drop to the floor on your right.                         
                                    However, you didn't account for the beast's massive claws.                                    
                                                                                                                                  
                           They tear into your suit, rending the plasteel and cutting into your torso.                            
                                      You weekly stab at the monster's limb with your bone,                                       
                            but it simply bounces off the hardened scales, making you drop the weapon.                            
                                                                                                                                  
    As the pain finally kicks in, you barely have the time to look down at your bleeding torso before you lose consciousness.     


                                                          You are dead.
